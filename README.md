# GlobalAmphibianConservationPriorities

Participants from the 2020 World Congress of Herpetology and a previous USGS Powell Center collaboration generated research questions to address the issue of future amphibian conservation priorities. As part of this initiative, research questions must be ranked by a wide audience of amphibian researchers in order to prioritize them based on geographic scale, feasibility (cost and length of time), and the number of species impacted.

This website hosts instructions for researchers to link to randomized subsections of the survey in addition to additional information about the research project.
