<h1>Survey Instructions</h1>
<p>Ranking research questions written by a global, collaborative initiative.</p>

<p>Dear Colleague,</p>

<p>In January, at the World Congress of Herpetology in New Zealand, we hosted a symposium and workshop, “Amphibian Conservation in the Anthropocene”, with the aim of identifying barriers and key uncertainties to conservation success and setting the stage for the identification of research priorities for amphibian conservation. Efforts by participants at the symposium in combination with the efforts of a similar USGS Powell Center initiative have generated a list of over 100 pressing research questions from participants conducting amphibian conservation research across the world.</p>

<p>We are ready for the next step in this process – to identify the most important, priority, research questions from among this set.  This involves the scoring and ranking of proposed research questions by amphibian researchers (you!). If you work on amphibian conservation, in whatever capacity, we request your help in ranking these research questions. Using criteria from Sutherland et al. (2009) to shape these questions, questions were generated by participants, and they were asked to pose those questions that address important gaps in knowledge not as general topic areas but rather as specific areas where research can be conducted. These questions can now be assessed based on their geographic scope, logistical feasibility, and potential impact.</p>

<p>If you are interested in lending your expertise to this effort, please see the link below to a Google Form that will take you to a randomized subset of these research questions, with further instructions on how to rank them. This survey should take you 50 minutes and will need to be done in a single session. We request that you complete this survey by 28 September.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance for considering this request.  We know your time is valuable and limited, and we appreciate your contribution to amphibian conservation now and in the future.</p>

<p>Please contact us with further questions or concerns,</p>
